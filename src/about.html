                <h5>Who is Tomas Volkovickas?</h5>
                <p class="flow-text">
                    Let's start with introductions. My name is Tomas Volkovickas and I am a software developer.
                    I am based in Nottingham, UK and currently work at Capital One. For the most up to date info check
                    my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomas-volkovickas">linkedIn</a> profile.
                </p>
                <h5>Experience</h5>
                <p class="flow-text">
                    My coding journey started with me joining the Computer Games Programming course at the University of
                    Derby. After 2 years I have joined a local software development company called PXtech as a placement
                    student. During my placement I have met plenty of great developers and will be forever grateful for
                    this
                    amazing opportunity. Since then, the course has been completed, few jobs changed and many projects
                    created and released
                    to customers. Unfortunately, even though I have finished games programming course, I am yet to work
                    on anything
                    related to games. That particular itch will remain and hopefully I will eventually ship my own
                    creation...One day!
                </p>
                <h5>Hobbies</h5>
                <p class="flow-text">
                    In my spare time I try to exercise and keep myself busy in general. My current passions are cycling
                    and
                    running.
                    Exercise is definitely a great way to unwind and is especially important for someone who spend so
                    much
                    time
                    sitting and coding.
                    Apart from exercise, I also enjoy a great book, film, tv show and of course...video games.
                </p>
                <h5>This website</h5>
                <p class="flow-text">
                    About this website. Well...it's not a blog. I won't be adding weekly or monthly updates. But I am
                    using it to try out new things.
                    For instance, I have recently scrapped my old linux server and this is now served from AWS Cloufront
                    CDN
                    as
                    a
                    static S3 site. In the future, I will use it to
                    showcase any new things I
                    learn or any interesting projects I am working on. Tom
                </p>
