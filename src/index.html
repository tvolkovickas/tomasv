        Let's start with introductions. My name is Tomas Volkovickas and I am a software developer.
        I am based in Nottingham, UK and currently work at Capital One. For the most up to date info check my <a

        My coding journey started with me joining the Computer Games Programming course at the University of Derby.
        After 2 years I have joined a local software development company called PXtech as a placement student.
        During my placement I have met plenty of great developers and will be forever grateful for this amazing
        opportunity.
        Since then, the course has been completed, few jobs changed and many projects created and released to customers.
        Unfortunately, even though I have finished games programming course, I am yet to work on anything related to
        games.
        That particular itch will remain and hopefully I will eventually ship my own creation...One day!

        In my spare time I try to exercise and keep myself busy in general. My current passions are cycling and running.
        Exercise is definitely a great way to unwind and is especially important for someone who spend so much time
        sitting and coding.
        Apart from exercise, I also enjoy a great book, film, tv show and of course...video games.

        About this website. Well...it's not a blog. I won't be adding weekly or monthly updates. But I am using it to
        try out new things.
        For instance, this is now served from AWS Cloufront. In the future, I will use it as a showcase of new things I
        learn or any interesting projects I am working on. Tom
